# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
